          <dd>Replaces the current version from the working copy with the contents of the selected
            revision from the history of the file. The <i>BASE</i> version of the file is not
            changed in the working copy so that after this action the file will appear as modified
            in a synchronization operation, that is newer than the <i>BASE</i> version, even if the
            contents is from an older version from history. </dd>

            revision. This option is active only when presenting the history for a repository item
            (URL). <note id="note_mnj_dgk_54b">This action can be used to resurrect deleted items also.</note></dd>

            working copy and do not affect the repository items. It does not replace your working
            copy items with those from the selected revisions. This action is available when the
            resource history was launched for a local working copy resource.<note id="note_onj_dgk_54b">For items
              displayed in the <uicontrol>Affected Paths</uicontrol> section that were <i>added</i>,
                <i>deleted</i>, or <i>replaced</i>, this action has no effect because such changes
              are considered to be changes to the parent directory. To revert these types of
              changes, follow these steps:<ol id="ul_ur2_ysd_4r">
                <li id="li_pnj_dgk_54b" irina="irina">Request the history for the parent directory.</li>

              to identify the corresponding working copy item for the selected item in the
                <uicontrol>Affected Paths</uicontrol> section. In this case, the action does not
              proceed and an error message is displayed. For example, the selected item in the
                <uicontrol>Affected Paths</uicontrol> section is from a different repository
              location than the working copy item that has the history displayed.</note></dd>

          <dd>Updates your working copy resource to the selected revision. This is useful if you
            want your working copy to reflect a time in the past. It is best to update a whole
            directory in your working copy, not just one file. Otherwise, your working copy is
            inconsistent and you are unable to commit your changes.</dd>
