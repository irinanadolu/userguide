    <p id="p_w3v_bgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Merge Directories with Change Tracking
        Highlights</uicontrol> tool can be used to merge two directories (based on a 2-way mode
      comparison) and all pairs of modified XML files involved in the process are merged by saving
      the comparison results as documents with highlighted tracked changes that can be later
      reviewed and accepted or rejected.</p>
    <p id="p_xlj_f1h_nyb">All other detected situations are treated based on several options that
      are applicable to both XML and non-XML files, or another option that is applicable only to
      non-XML files.</p>
    <p id="p_ylj_f1h_nyb">To invoke the tool, select the <uicontrol>Merge Directories with Change
        Tracking Highlights</uicontrol> action that is found in the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Comparison Tools</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> menu. It opens a dialog box where you can specify the directories to merge and
      the output directory to save the results, as well as some other options.</p>

          <dd>The merge process has a preliminary phase where the entire structure and the content
            of the base directory is copied to the output directory. The following merge options are

                  <dd>If this option is selected, all files in the output directory that are copies
                    of non-XML files in the base directory are replaced by their corresponding files
                    in the directory to merge with. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.</dd>

                  <dd>If this option is selected, all files that are only present in the directory
                    to merge with are also added to the output directory.<p>
                      <dl>
                        <dlentry>
                          <dt>Create change tracking markers for the XML files to be added</dt>
                          <dd>
                            <p>This option can only be used in conjunction with the <uicontrol>Add
                                the files found only in the directory to merge with</uicontrol>
                              option. Select this option if you want to create change tracking
                              markers for the XML files that are only present in the directory to
                              merge with and will be added to the output directory. Although these
                              files have no counterparts in the base directory, change tracking
                              markers of type "entire content added/inserted" will be created.</p>
                            <p>The option is not necessarily intended for the merge process itself,
                              but it is useful if you want to apply various <i>Oxygen</i>
                              transformation scenarios to the resulting output directory. For
                              example, if you merge 2 versions of a DITA project and then want a PDF
                              to highlight the changes between those versions, you can apply a
                              transformation on the resulting <filepath>ditamap</filepath> file.
                              This option results in presenting the new DITA files as "added
                              content" in the resulting PDF.</p>

                  <dt>Delete the files found only in the base directory</dt>
                  <dd>If this option is selected, all files that are only present in the base
                    directory and initially copied to the output directory are deleted. Otherwise,
                    they are preserved.</dd>

    <p id="p_mzx_czj_vpb">Once the merge operation is complete, loading the report file in <ph
        keyref="product"/> provides additional functionality. Aside from the fact that the report
      provides an overview of the merge process, it also provides links to all the files in the
      resulting output directory. This is helpful for generating XML documents with tracked changes.
      For example, you can use the respective links to load these XML files in
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode to review the tracked changes and accept or reject them.
      This phase of reviewing and manually merging the XML files is typically the final phase of the
      entire merge procedure.</p>
