    <p id="p_l3h_4ms_prb">To integrate the <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> commenting system, you first need
      to create an account along with an organization. The organization groups all of the users,
      site configurations, and all the related data that is isolated from other organizations. When
      you create an account and organization, you are automatically assigned the role of the
      organization <b><term keyref="glossentry_fb_owner"/></b>.</p>

            account will be created within the organization that integrated the Feedback component
            and you will not be assigned as the owner (since the owner was already established when
