        <title>Possible Cause</title>
        <p id="p_b2k_dgk_54b">This could happen if you change the site/version configuration after
          the comment was posted because the association between the page and the previously posted
          comment would be lost. That association is directly dependent upon the <xref
            href="ofb-version-management.dita#ofb-version-management/dlentry_wdy_34x_5wb"><b>Base
              URL</b> configured for the associated version</xref>. When a comment is posted, the
            <b>Base URL</b> is used to obtain a relative path from the page URL and the comment is
          associated with that relative path. Therefore, if you change the <b>Base URL</b> after a
          comment is posted, the relative path of the page computed for the new <b>Base URL</b> and
          the relative path associated with the comment in the database will not match. This results
          in the comment no longer being displayed on that page.</p>

            <li id="li_lxz_xgn_2pb" irina="irina">Suppose the original <b>Base URL</b> for a particular version of
              a site configuration
              is:<codeblock outputclass="language-ini">https://example.com/docs/myProduct/</codeblock></li>

            <li id="li_pbf_jhn_2pb" irina="irina"><b>Oxygen Feedback</b> will associate the user's comment to the
