          <li id="li_nl5_dgk_54b" irina="irina">System requirements: On the server running Content Fusion, you need enough disk space
            to create a backup. The backup file contains a compressed archive of all files located
            in <filepath>/fusion/data/</filepath>, so to be safe, the free space should be at least
            equal to the size of the data folder.</li>
