    <p id="p_uh3_dgk_54b">Users of bug tracking systems can associate the changes they make in the repository resources
      with a specific ID in their bug tracking system. The only requirement is that the user
      includes the bug ID in the commit message that they enter in the <uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol>
      dialog box. The format and the location of the ID in the commit message are configured with
      SVN properties.</p>
    <p id="p_vh3_dgk_54b">To make the integration possible <ph keyref="svnProduct"/> needs some data about the bug
      tracking tool used in the project. You can configure this using the following <xref
        href="show-properties.dita">SVN properties</xref> that must be set on the folder that
      contains resources associated with the bug tracking system (usually they are set recursively
      on the root folder of the working copy):</p>
    <ul id="ul_wh3_dgk_54b">
      <li id="li_xh3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:message</uicontrol> - A string property. If it is set the <xref
          href="send-changes.dita"><uicontrol>Commit</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> will display a
        text field for entering the bug ID. It must contain the string <i>%BUGID%</i>, which is
        replaced with the bug number on commit.</li>
      <li id="li_yh3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:label</uicontrol> - A string property that sets the label for the text
        field configured with the <uicontrol>bugtraq:message</uicontrol> property.</li>
      <li id="li_zh3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:url</uicontrol> - A string property that is the URL pointing to the bug
        tracking tool. The URL string should contain the substring <i>%BUGID%</i> which <ph
          keyref="svnProduct"/> replaces with the issue number. That way the resulting URL will
        point directly to the correct issue.</li>
      <li id="li_a33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:warnifnoissue</uicontrol> - A boolean property with the values
          <i>true</i>/<i>yes</i> or <i>false</i>/<i>no</i>. If set to <i>true</i>, the <ph
          keyref="svnProduct"/> will warn you if the bug ID text field is left empty. The warning
        will not block the commit, only give you a chance to enter an issue number.</li>
      <li id="li_b33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:number</uicontrol> - A boolean property with the value <i>true</i> or
          <i>false</i>. If this property is set to <i>false</i>, then any character can be entered
        in the bug ID text field. If the property is set to <i>true</i> or is missing then only
        numbers are allowed as the bug ID.</li>
      <li id="li_c33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:append</uicontrol> - A boolean property. If set to <i>false</i>, then
        the bug ID is inserted at the beginning of the commit message. If <i>yes</i> or not set,
        then it is appended to the commit message.</li>
      <li id="li_d33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>bugtraq:logregex</uicontrol> - This property contains one or two regular
        expressions, separated by a newline. If only one expression is set, then the bug ID's must
        be matched in the groups of the regular expression string (for example, <codeph>[Ii]ssue
          #?(\d+)</codeph>). If two expressions are set, then the first expression is used to find a
        string which relates to a bug ID but may contain more than just the bug ID (for example,
          <codeph>Issue #123</codeph> or <codeph>resolves issue 123</codeph>). The second expression
        is then used to extract the bug ID from the string extracted with the first expression. An
        example: if you want to catch every pattern <codeph>issue #XXX</codeph> and <codeph>issue
          #890, #789</codeph> inside a log message you could use the following strings:<ul id="ul_e33_dgk_54b">
          <li id="li_f33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><codeph>[Ii]ssue #?(\d+)(,? ?#?(\d+))+</codeph></li>
          <li id="li_g33_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><codeph>(\d+)</codeph></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p_h33_dgk_54b">The data configured with these SVN properties is stored on the repository when a revision is
      committed. A bug tracking system or a statistics tool can retrieve the revisions that affected
      a bug from the SVN server and present the commits related to that bug to the user of the bug
      tracking system.</p>
    <p id="p_i33_dgk_54b">If the <uicontrol>bugtraq:url</uicontrol> property was filled in with the URL of the bug
      tracking system and this URL includes the <i>%BUGID%</i> substring as specified above in the
      description of the <uicontrol>bugtraq:url</uicontrol> property then the <xref
        href="history-view.dita"><uicontrol>History</uicontrol> view</xref> presents the bug ID as a
      hyperlink in the commit message. Clicking such a hyperlink in the commit message of a revision
      opens a Web browser at the page corresponding to the bug affected by that commit.</p>
