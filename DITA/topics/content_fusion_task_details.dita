    <p id="p_yq2_hmz_txb"><uicontrol>Review Tasks</uicontrol> is one of the two main components
      (along with <b>Projects</b>) within the Content Fusion browser interface. When you navigate to
        <uicontrol>Review Tasks</uicontrol>, the <uicontrol>My Review Tasks</uicontrol> page is
      opened in the main area. It displays a list of all the current tasks that are owned by you and
      those that are assigned to you.<note id="note_j3d_zfg_zxb" type="tip">There are several ways
        to reach the <uicontrol>My Review Task</uicontrol> page. You click the <uicontrol><image
            href="../img/ShowFusion18.png" id="image_q2d_1h3_4jb"/>Oxygen Content Fusion</uicontrol>
        logo on the left side of the top ribbon, select <uicontrol>My Review Tasks</uicontrol> from
        the user drop-down menu in the top stripe, click the <uicontrol>Review Tasks</uicontrol>
        button in the left stripe (if you are in the main <uicontrol>Projects</uicontrol> page),
        click on <uicontrol>Review Tasks</uicontrol> in the top stripe (if a page within a review
        task or project is open), or you can use the breadcrumb (if a page within a review task is
        open).</note></p>

        <uicontrol>Owned By Me</uicontrol> tab. To see tasks that have been assigned to you, click
      the <uicontrol>Assigned To Me</uicontrol> tab. The table also has columns that show the
        <uicontrol>Owners</uicontrol> of the review task (shown only in the <uicontrol>Assigned To

      closed, the status is displayed as <uicontrol>Review closed</uicontrol>.</p>
