    <p id="p_vww_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Community</uicontrol> page (accessible after selecting a
      site configuration from the <uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> page) is where users with a role of
        <i>Owner</i>, <i>Admin</i>, or <i>Moderator</i> can see the members of the site management
      team (for the particular site configuration) and any other user who has posted a comment on
      the website where the Feedback system is installed for the particular site configuration. To
      reach this page, click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ofb-Community16.png"
          id="image_txz_51g_gjb"/>Community</uicontrol> link in the left menu bar in the interface
      for the site configuration.</p>
    <p id="p_www_dgk_54b">Users with a role of site <i>Owner</i> or <i>Admin</i> for the site
      configuration can change user roles from this page.</p>

      role. For example a user with an <b>organization</b> role of <i>Admin</i> cannot be assigned a
        <b>site</b> role of <i>Moderator</i>. An <b>organization</b>
      <i>Owner</i> is also indirectly considered to have a role of <b>site</b>
