    <p id="p_yvt_dgk_54b">Review tasks that are created by the <b>Content Author</b> are automatically assigned to that
        <b>Content Author</b> as the task owner. It is possible to add additional owners to an
      existing task so that more than one <b>Content Author</b> can manage the task or merge the
      changes in <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>.</p>
    <p id="p_zvt_dgk_54b">To add an additional owner to a review task:</p>

      <ol id="ol_bwt_dgk_54b">
        <li id="li_cwt_dgk_54b" irina="irina">Open the task in the Content Fusion browser interface.</li>
        <li id="li_dwt_dgk_54b" irina="irina">
          <p id="p_ewt_dgk_54b">Click the <uicontrol>Share</uicontrol> button located in the top
            stripe.</p>
          <p id="p_fwt_dgk_54b"><b>Step Result:</b> This opens the <uicontrol>Sharing settings</uicontrol> dialog box
            where you can decide who has access to the task and add collaborators.</p>

        <li id="li_iwt_dgk_54b" irina="irina">If the person who you want assigned as an owner is listed, change their role from
            <uicontrol>Reviewer</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>Owner</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li id="li_jwt_dgk_54b" irina="irina">If they are not already listed, start typing the name or email in
          the <uicontrol>Add collaborator</uicontrol> field and the system will search for
          assignable users that can be selected from a drop-down menu. Click the
            <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> button to add them to the list. If the name/email is not in
          the system, they will be listed as a <i>Pending Collaborator</i> until they sign up for an
          account and they access the task via its link. Once a collaborator is no longer pending,
          the task owner can change the role for any of the assigned collaborators from
            <uicontrol>Reviewer</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>Owner</uicontrol>, and vice versa.<note
            id="note_kwt_dgk_54b">The assignable users are based upon validated email addresses for
            each <ph keyref="cfEnterprise"/> installation. If you need to limit the assignable users
            to a particular department within your organization (for example), it is recommended to
            have a separate <ph keyref="cfEnterprise"/> installation for each
          department.</note></li>

    <p id="p_mwt_dgk_54b"><b>Result:</b> The new owner is now assigned as one of the owners of the
      task. The task is now listed as one of the <uicontrol>Review tasks owned by me</uicontrol> in
      the <xref href="content_fusion_task_details.dita"><uicontrol>My Review Tasks</uicontrol>
        page</xref> and the task is also added in the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks
        Manager</uicontrol> view for the new owner (for those that use <i>Oxygen XML
        Editor/Author</i>).</p>
