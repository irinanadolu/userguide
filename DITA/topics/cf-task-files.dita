    <p>The <uicontrol>Task Files</uicontrol> page lists all the files that are attached to the
      task.</p>

    <p>You can click on a file to open it in the visual editor. If other people have the file open,
      you will see their avatars next to the file. You can hover over an avatar to see the name of
      the person.</p>
    <p>If the <xref href="cf-concurrent-editing.dita"><b>Concurrent Editing</b> feature</xref> is
      enabled for a particular task, multiple people can work on the same file simultaneously.
      Otherwise, only one person can edit the file at once. If someone else is currently editing the
      particular file, you will see a <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF_Lock20.png"
          id="image_osm_j1p_zxb"/>Lock</uicontrol> icon on the left side of the
        <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> box and that person's avatar will have a red border. When a
      file is locked, no one else can edit the file until that person navigates out of the visual
      editor, closes the browser, or uses the <uicontrol>Finalize My Review</uicontrol> button. If
      you hover over the lock icon, it will show you who has the file locked.</p>
    <p>To edit the name of a task, click the <image href="../img/CF-edit18.png"
        id="image_d4c_nbp_zxb"/> icon to the right of the task name, change the name, then click the
      check mark on the right side.</p>
    <p>To download the task, click the <image href="../img/CF-download18.png" id="image_h4t_tbp_zxb"
      /> icon to the right of the task name. This downloads a zip archive that contains all task
      files, along with change history downloaded as a Git working directory (making changes
      traceable). To inspect the history, extract the archive and open the root directory in your
      Git client. Information about the email and author name of the person who made the change in
        <b>Content Fusion</b> is included.</p>
    <p id="p_t1j_nfl_b1c">Under the title of the task, you can see the <xref
        href="CF-task-states-user-roles.dita#CF-task-states-user-roles/section_vkk_v4s_1yb">status
        of the review task</xref>, details about the number of reviewers who have <xref
        href="finishing_tasks.dita">finalized the task</xref>, and information about when its due
      (if a due date is specified in the <xref href="cf-task-settings.dita"><uicontrol>Task
          Settings</uicontrol> page</xref>). You can click on the <uicontrol>Finalized</uicontrol>
      widget (drop-down) to see the status for each assigned reviewer:</p>
    <p><image href="../img/cf-finalized-widget.png"/></p>
    <p id="p_yfw_x22_h1c">If a task <i>owner</i> clicks on the <uicontrol>Finalized</uicontrol>
      widget (drop-down) for a task that has reviewers who have finalized their review, the task
      owner has access to a <uicontrol>Request re-review</uicontrol> button. Clicking this button
      resets the finalized status for all reviewers and their status is changed to <i>In
        progress</i>. Also, if the task owner re-opens a <xref href="cf-closing-tasks.dita">closed
        task</xref>, the finalized status is reset for all reviewers.</p>
    <p id="p_yrn_zk2_h1c">When a reviewer opens a task that the owner requested that they do another
      review, the <uicontrol>Task Files</uicontrol> page includes a <uicontrol>Changed files
        only</uicontrol> filter option to make it easy to identify which files have changes that
      need to be reviewed again.</p>
