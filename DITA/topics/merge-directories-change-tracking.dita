        Highlights</uicontrol> script (<codeph>mergeDirsTrackChanges.sh</codeph>, found in the
        <filepath>scripts</filepath> subfolder inside <b>Oxygen's</b> installation directory) can be
      used to merge 2 directories (based on a 2-way comparison). All pairs of modified XML files
      involved in the process are merged by saving the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode comparison
      results as documents with highlighted tracked changes that can be later reviewed and accepted
      or rejected.</p>

                previously mentioned situations, a backup copy of the base directory will be kept on

              only present in the directory to merge with (that will be added to the output
              directory). Although these files have no counterparts in the base directory, change
              tracking markers of the type "entire content added/inserted" will be created. The
              option is not necessarily intended for the merge process itself, but it might prove a
              useful addition when you want to apply various <term>Oxygen</term> transformation
              scenarios to the resulting output directory. For example, if you merge 2 versions of a
              DITA project and then want a PDF to highlight the changes between those versions, you
              can apply a transformation on the resulting <filepath>ditamap</filepath> file. The
                <codeph>-am</codeph> option presents the new DITA files as "added content" in the
              resulting PDF. Note that the option is only considered if the <codeph>-na</codeph>
              argument is absent or is explicitly set to <b>false</b> (default value).</dd>

            additional functionality. Aside from the fact that the report provides an overview of
            the merge process, it also provides links to all the files in the resulting output
            directory. You can use the respective links to load the XML files in the editor, then
            switch to <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode to review the tracked changes and accept or
            reject them.</li>
