        <p id="p_s5r_bgk_54b">Each type of file is associated with a type of editor that opens the files of that type
      for editing. The editor can be the built-in one specially provided for the file type (for
      example, the internal XML editor, the internal XSLT editor, the internal XSL-FO editor, etc)
      or an external application installed on the computer, either the default system application
      associated with that file type in the operating system or other particular application
      specified by the path to its executable file. To configure SVN file formats, <ph
        conkeyref="reusables-preferences-pages/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to <uicontrol>SVN
        File Editors</uicontrol>.</p>

        <p id="p_u5r_bgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> button or a double-click a table row opens a dialog box
      for specifying the editor associated with the file type. The same dialog box is displayed on
      opening a file from one of the <ph keyref="product"/> views.</p>

      </fig>
    </p>
        <p id="p_w5r_bgk_54b">In this dialog box are offered three options for opening a file:</p>
        <ul id="ul_x5r_bgk_54b">
            <li id="li_y5r_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>System default application</uicontrol> - Opens the selected file using
                the application that is associated with that file extension by default in the
                operating system.</li>
            <li id="li_z5r_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>System application</uicontrol> - Opens the selected file using an
        external application that you have to specify by the path of its executable file. Also, you
        can specify some arguments for the command line of that application, if they are needed.
        This option also works for directories, if you want to choose a file browser other than the
        system default.</li>
            <li id="li_avr_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Internal editor</uicontrol> - Allows you to select an editor type from
        the built-in editors that are included in <ph keyref="product"/>. By default, this option is
        disabled when selecting directories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p_bvr_bgk_54b">If a file type is associated with an internal editor other than an XML editor type then
      the encoding set in <xref href="preferences-encoding.dita">the preference for
          <uicontrol>Encoding for non XML files</uicontrol></xref> is used for opening and saving a
      file of that type. This is necessary because in the case of XML files, the encoding is usually
      declared at the beginning of the XML file in a special declaration or it assumes the default
      value UTF-8, but in the case of non-XML files there is no standard mechanism for declaring the
      encoding of the file.</p>
