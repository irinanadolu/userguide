  <title>Track Changes Limitations</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_dmx_bgk_54b">There are some inherent limitations to the <xref
        keyref="glossentry_track-changes"><term>Change Tracking</term></xref> feature. These limitations include the following:<ul id="ul_emx_bgk_54b">
        <li id="li_fmx_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Limitations to rejected changes</b> - Recording changes has limitations and there is
          no guarantee that rejecting all changes will return the document exactly to its original
          state.</li>
        <li id="li_gmx_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Limitations to hierarchical changes</b> - Recorded changes are not hierarchical, a
          change cannot contain other changes inside. For example, if you delete an insertion made
          by another user, then reject the deletion, the information about the author who made the
          previous insertion is not preserved.</li>
        <li id="li_hmx_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Limitations to using certain actions</b> - Some actions cannot be
          implemented with the <xref keyref="glossentry_track-changes"><term>Track Changes</term>
            feature</xref> enabled. For example, some table-related actions (<uicontrol><image
              href="../img/DeleteRow16.png"/>Delete Row(s)</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/DeleteColumn16.gif"/>Delete Column(s)</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/TableJoin16.png"/>Join Cells</uicontrol>, <uicontrol><image
              href="../img/TableSplitCell16.png"/>Split Cell</uicontrol>) ignore the <term>Track
            Changes</term> feature. </li>
        <li id="li_imx_bgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Possible Serialization Limitation</b> - If you have equivalent
          adjacent tracked changes, for example, you see two back-to-back changes in the
            <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> pane that have identical properties (the same user,
          timestamp, content, etc.), when you save the document, it is sometimes possible for the
          document to only contain a single processing instruction.</li>
