    <p id="p_jf3_dgk_54b">A <i>tree conflict</i> is a conflict at the directory tree structure level and occurs when
      the user runs an update action on a resource that has the following conditions:</p>
    <ul id="ul_kf3_dgk_54b">
      <li id="li_lf3_dgk_54b" irina="irina">It is locally modified and the same resource was deleted from the repository (or deleted
        as a result of being renamed or moved).</li>
      <li id="li_mf3_dgk_54b" irina="irina">It was locally deleted (or deleted as a result of being renamed or moved) and the same
        resource is incoming as modified from the repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p_nf3_dgk_54b">The same conflict situation can occur after a merge or a switch action. The action ends with
      an error and the folder containing the file that is now in the tree conflict state is also
      marked with a conflict icon.</p>
    <p id="p_of3_dgk_54b">Such a conflict can be resolved in one of the following ways that are available when the
      user double clicks on the conflicting resource or when running the <uicontrol>Edit
        conflict</uicontrol> action:</p>
