    <p id="p_vww_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Members</uicontrol> page is where users with a role of
      organization <i>Owner</i> or <i>Admin</i> can see all the member attached to the organization.
      Users with a role of organization <i>Owner</i> or <i>Admin</i> can also invite new members and
      change user roles.</p>
    <p id="p_wgr_qmz_prb">To invite a new member:<ol id="ol_mtd_sks_5rb">
        <li id="li_ntd_sks_5rb" irina="irina">Enter their email address in the <uicontrol>Email</uicontrol> field
          at the top (you can enter multiple email addresses to invite multiple members at
          once).</li>
        <li id="li_smd_5ks_5rb" irina="irina">Choose a role for them. This role will be assigned to each of the
          invited users when they register their accounts.</li>
        <li id="li_rvp_xks_5rb" irina="irina">Click the <uicontrol>Invite</uicontrol> button. An email is sent to
          the new member and they will be listed in the <uicontrol>Pending Invitations</uicontrol>
          tab until they accept the invitation. Also in the <uicontrol>Pending
            Invitations</uicontrol> tab, you can click the vertical ellipsis to the far right of the
          user's name to access actions to <uicontrol>Resend invition</uicontrol> or
            <uicontrol>Delete invition</uicontrol> (this will delete the current invitation even if
          the user has received the link).</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p id="p_exw_dgk_54b">To change the role of any existing user, select the new role from the
