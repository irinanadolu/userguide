  <title>Page Breaks Between Lines: Widows and Orphans</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_aw5_dgk_54b">There are cases where a page break is placed between paragraph lines. Typically, for
      aesthetic purposes, the first paragraph should have more than one line. Another constraint
      might be the number of lines that are moved to the next page and again, it should avoid
      leaving a single line. <xref
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-break-20120823/#best-breaks" scope="external"
        format="html">CSS defines two properties</xref> for this type of control:</p>
    <p id="p_bw5_dgk_54b"><ul id="ol_ag5_hzm_vz">
        <li id="li_cw5_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><b><codeph>orphans</codeph></b> -  This property specifies the minimum number of line
          boxes that should be left in a paragraph before the page break occurs. </li>
        <li id="li_dw5_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><b><codeph>widows</codeph></b> - This property specifies the minimum number of line
          boxes of a block container that must be left in a paragraph created on the next page after
          a break.</li>
      </ul>The following example shows how to keep the paragraphs at least four lines on the page
      before the break, and two lines on the page following the break:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css" id="codeblock_ew5_dgk_54b">p {
  orphans: 4;
  widows: 2;
}</codeblock>
    <p id="p_fw5_dgk_54b">
      <note id="note_gw5_dgk_54b">As a difference from the W3C standard, the <codeph>widows</codeph> and
          <codeph>orphans</codeph> CSS properties are applied to lists as well (the default is 2).
        This means that a list that spans consecutive pages will have either zero or at least 2
        lines on each of the pages.</note>
