  <title>Automatic Subscription Renewal</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Oxygen License Server</uicontrol> has a mechanism that tries to detect when
      you purchase a renewal of your current subscription and automatically updates the license
      key.</p>
    <p>To determine that a license key you purchased is a renewal of the license key you have
      currently installed in the License Server, it uses the <uicontrol>Previous order reference
        number</uicontrol> if you inserted it in the checkout process.</p>
    <p>This automatic renewal mechanism makes an HTTP request to
        <i>https://oxygenxml.com/subscription_management/check_renewal.php</i> and passes the
      following as parameters:</p>
    <ul id="ul_l5r_hm5_t5b">
      <li irina="irina">The SGN field of the existing license key.</li>
      <li irina="irina">The server signature that uniquely identifies the License Server installation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This request is made by the License Server automatically (or manually by pressing the
        <uicontrol>Check now</uicontrol> link). </p>
    <p>This mechanism can be disabled by deselecting the <uicontrol>Automatically check for
        subscription renewal</uicontrol> checkbox.</p>
