    <p id="p_vj3_dgk_54b">In the <xref href="properties-view.dita"><uicontrol>Properties</uicontrol> view</xref> you
      can read and set the <tm tmtype="tm">Apache Subversion</tm> properties of a file or folder.
      There is a set of predefined properties with special meaning to Subversion. For more
      information about properties in Subversion see the SVN Subversion specification. Subversion
      properties are revision-dependent. After you change, add or delete a property for a resource,
      you have to commit your changes to the repository.</p>
    <p id="p_wj3_dgk_54b">If you want to change the properties of a given resource you need to select that resource
      from the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref>
      and run the <uicontrol>Show properties</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu. The <xref
        href="properties-view.dita"><uicontrol>Properties</uicontrol> view</xref> will show the
      local properties for the resource in the working copy. Once the <u>Properties</u> view is
      visible, it will always present the properties of the currently selected resource. There are
      actions available in the <uicontrol>Properties</uicontrol> view <xref
        href="properties-toolbar.dita">toolbar</xref> that allows you to add, change, and delete the
      properties.</p>
    <p id="p_xj3_dgk_54b">If you choose the <uicontrol>Add a new property</uicontrol> action, a new dialog box will
      appear that contains the following:<ul id="ul_yj3_dgk_54b">
        <li id="li_zj3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Name</uicontrol> - Combo box that allows you to enter the name of the
          property. The drop-down menu of the combo box presents the predefined Subversion
          properties (such as <uicontrol>svn:ignore</uicontrol>,
            <uicontrol>svn:externals</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>svn:needs-lock</uicontrol>, etc.)</li>
        <li id="li_ak3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Current value</uicontrol> - Text area that allows you to enter the value of
          the new property.</li>
      </ul>If the selected item is a directory, you can also set the property recursively on its
      children by selecting the <uicontrol>Set property recursively</uicontrol> checkbox.</p>
    <p id="p_bk3_dgk_54b">If you want to change the value for a previously set property, you can use the
        <uicontrol>Edit property</uicontrol> action, which will display a dialog box with the
      following information:</p>
    <ul id="ul_ck3_dgk_54b">
      <li id="li_dk3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Name</uicontrol> - Property name (cannot be changed).</li>
      <li id="li_ek3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Current value</uicontrol> - The current value (can be changed).</li>
      <li id="li_fk3_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Base value</uicontrol> - The value of the property, if any, from the resource
        in the pristine copy (cannot be changed).</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p_gk3_dgk_54b">If you want to completely remove a property previously set you can choose the
        <uicontrol>Remove property</uicontrol> action. It will display a confirmation dialog box where you can also choose if the property will be removed recursively.</p>
    <p id="p_hk3_dgk_54b">There is a <uicontrol>Refresh</uicontrol> action in the <xref href="properties-view.dita"
          ><uicontrol>Properties</uicontrol> view</xref> that can be used when the properties have
      been changed from outside the view. This can happen, for example, when the view was already
      presenting the properties of a resource and they have been changed after an
        <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> operation.</p>
