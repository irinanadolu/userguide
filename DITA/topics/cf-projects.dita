    <p id="p_o2t_pl3_vxb"><ph keyref="product"/> offers the ability to connect to an existing Git
      repository that has a DITA project as its source. This is managed within the Content Fusion
      browser interface through a feature known as <term>Projects</term>. A <b>Content Author</b>
      can create review tasks inside a project and reviewers' suggestions are tracked on a dedicated
      branch in the Git repository. A <b>Content Author</b> can also use the <term>Projects</term>
      feature to build and configure deliverables for creating PDF or <xref

      <title>User Roles</title>
      <p>When working with projects, there are two user roles:<ul>
          <li irina="irina"><b>SME (Subject Matter Expert/Reviewer)</b> - By default, Content Fusion users have
            the SME (Subject Matter Expert) role assigned. This role allows the user to access
            review tasks assigned to them and to create review tasks from scratch.</li>
          <li irina="irina"><b>Author</b> - This role must be assigned to a user by an administrator. In addition
            to the features that an SME has access to, Authors can access all projects and are able
            to create review tasks inside projects, as well as other functionality that is
            restricted from an SME.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>The license for Content Fusion covers a number of user-based licenses for authors and a
        number of floating licenses for SMEs. A system administrator can assign roles from the <xref
          href="cf-enterprise-configuration.dita">Administration page</xref>.</p>
