    <p product="editor author developer" id="p_u4j_dgk_54b">You can open a file for editing in an internal built-in editor. There
      are default associations between frequently used file types and the internal editors in <xref keyref="file-types-preferences">the File Types preferences panel</xref>.</p>
    <p product="svnClient" id="p_v4j_dgk_54b"> You can open a file for editing in the following:</p>
    <ul product="svnClient" id="ul_w4j_dgk_54b">
      <li id="li_x4j_dgk_54b" irina="irina">An internal built-in editor.</li>
      <li id="li_y4j_dgk_54b" irina="irina">The default external application associated in the operating system with the file
        type.</li>
      <li id="li_z4j_dgk_54b" irina="irina">An external application installed in the operating system and specified by the path to its
        executable launcher.</li>
    </ul>
    <p product="svnClient" id="p_apj_dgk_54b">There are default associations between frequently used file types and the
      internal editors, but <xref href="preferences-svn-file-editors.dita">new associations can be
        added and the default associations can be modified</xref> with the <uicontrol>Open
        with</uicontrol> action that is available in <xref href="repository-view.dita">the
        Repository view</xref>, <xref href="working-copy-view.dita">the Working Copy view</xref>,
      and <xref href="history-view.dita">the History view</xref>. This opens the following dialog
      box:</p>
    <p product="svnClient" id="p_bpj_dgk_54b">
      <fig id="fig_cpj_dgk_54b">
        <title><uicontrol>Open With</uicontrol> Dialog Box</title>
        <image href="../img/sa_svn_open_with_dialog.png"/>
      </fig>
    </p>
    <p id="p_dpj_dgk_54b">The internal editor can be accessed either from the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita">Working copy view</xref> or from the <xref href="history-view.dita">History view</xref>. No
      actions that modify the content are allowed when the editor is opened with a revision from
      history.</p>
    <p id="p_epj_dgk_54b">Only one file at a time can be edited in an internal editor. If you try to open another file
      it will be opened in the same editor window. The editor provides syntax highlighting for known
      file types. This means that a different color will be used for each recognized token type
      found in the file. If the file's content type is unknown you will be prompted to choose the
      proper way the file should be opened.</p>
    <p id="p_fpj_dgk_54b">After editing the content of the file in an internal editor you can save it to disk by using
      the <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> action from the <xref href="svn-main-menu.dita">File</xref>
      menu or the <uicontrol conkeyref="reusable-oxygen-shortcuts-list/ctrl_s"/> key shortcut. After
      saving your file you can see the file changed status in <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"
        >the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p_gpj_dgk_54b">If the internal editor associated with a file type is not the XML Editor, then the encoding
      set in <xref href="preferences-encoding.dita">the preferences for <i>Encoding for non XML
          files</i></xref> is used for opening and saving a file of that type. This is necessary
      because in the case of XML files, the encoding is usually declared at the beginning of the XML
      file in a special declaration or it assumes the default value UTF-8, but in the case of
      non-XML files, there is no standard mechanism for declaring the encoding for the file. </p>
