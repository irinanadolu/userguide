    <p>This page includes the following options:</p>
    <p>
      <dl id="dl_fdj_z2p_zxb">
        <dlentry id="dlentry_j4x_md2_yzb">
          <dt>Task Title</dt>
          <dd>You can edit the title for the task in this field. Click the check mark on the right
            side when you are done.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry id="dlentry_osj_rd2_yzb">
          <dt>Due Date</dt>
          <dd>You can optionally specify a <uicontrol>Due Date</uicontrol> and the amount of time
            left before the due date arrives is displayed under the review task's title when you
            have navigated inside the task and also in the table in the <xref
              href="content_fusion_task_details.dita"><uicontrol>My Review Tasks</uicontrol>
              page</xref>. Also, any reviewers who have not finalized the task will receive an email
            notification when the due date is within 3 days, 1 day, and 12 hours of its
            expiration.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Enable Concurrent Editing</dt>
          <dd>If this option is selected, multiple reviewers who have access to the task can edit
            and review the same document simultaneously. They can all see who is modifying the
            document in both the main visual editor and in the activity stream on the left side of
            the interface, in real time. For more information, see <xref
              href="cf-concurrent-editing.dita"/>.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Reviewers Edit Mode</dt>
          <dd>This controls the type of editing that reviewers are allowed to do on documents for a
            particular task. You can choose between the following:<ul>
              <li irina="irina"><uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> (default) - Reviewers are allowed to edit documents
                within the task.</li>
              <li irina="irina"><uicontrol>Suggest using change tracking</uicontrol> - <i>Change Tracking</i> is
                always on when the <b>Reviewers</b> make changes or add comments in the documents
                attached to the task. This allows you and other <b>Reviewers</b> to see exactly what
                has been changed and you will have the ability to accept or reject the changes after
                you have integrated them back into <term>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</term>.</li>
              <li irina="irina"><uicontrol>Comment only</uicontrol> - Reviewers are only allowed to add comments
                in the documents attached to the task.</li>
            </ul></dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Delete</dt>
          <dd>Selecting this action will delete the task from the <ph keyref="product"/>
            server.</dd>
