      <title>What is Preserved During an Upgrade?</title>
      <p id="p_wmn_bgk_54b">When you install a new version of <ph keyref="product"/>, first you need to remove or
        rename the old installation directory. By renaming the directory, it can coexist with the
        new installation and the following data will be preserved:<ul id="ul_g33_wkx_x4">
          <li id="li_xmn_bgk_54b" irina="irina">All the files from the old install directory will be preserved, including any
            modification in <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>framework</term></xref> files,
            XSLT stylesheets, <xref keyref="glossentry_xml-catalog"><term>XML
            Catalogs</term></xref>, and templates. However, these modifications will not be
            automatically imported into the new installation.</li>
          <li id="li_ymn_bgk_54b" irina="irina">All global user preferences are preserved in the new version.</li>
          <li id="li_zmn_bgk_54b" irina="irina">All project preferences will be preserved in their project files. </li>
          <li id="li_ann_bgk_54b" irina="irina">Any custom <xref keyref="glossentry_framework"><term>frameworks</term></xref> that
            were stored outside the installation directory (as configured in <xref
              href="framework-location.dita#framework-location"><menucascade>
                <uicontrol>Document type associations</uicontrol>
                <uicontrol>Locations</uicontrol>
              </menucascade></xref>) will be preserved and will be found by the new
            installation.</li>

            minor version to a major version (for example, from 16.1 to 17.0) and you did not
            purchase a Maintenance Pack that covers the new major version, you will need to enter a
            new license for the new version into the registration dialog box that is displayed when
            the plugin is started.</li>
