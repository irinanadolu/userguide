    <p id="p_aqj_dgk_54b">In the <ph keyref="product"/>, there are three types of files that can be checked for
      differences: text files, image files and binary files. For the text files and image files you
      can use the built-in <uicontrol>Compare</uicontrol> view. This view is automatically opened if
      you select two files and use the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Compare with</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Each Other</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action in the contextual menu.</p>

    </p>
        <p id="p_dqj_dgk_54b">At the top of each of the two editors, there are presented the name of the open file,
            the corresponding SVN revision number (for remote resources) and the author who
            committed the associated revision.</p>
        <p id="p_eqj_dgk_54b">When comparing text, the differences are computed using a <i>line differencing
        algorithm</i>. The view can be used to show the differences between two files in the
      following cases: <ul id="ul_fqj_dgk_54b">
        <li id="li_gqj_dgk_54b" irina="irina">After obtaining the outgoing status of a file with a <uicontrol>Refresh</uicontrol>
          operation, the view can be used to show the differences between your working file and the
          pristine copy. In this way you can find out what changes you will be committing.</li>
        <li id="li_hqj_dgk_54b" irina="irina">After obtaining the incoming and outgoing status of the file with the
            <uicontrol>Synchronize</uicontrol> operation, you can examine the exact differences
          between your local file and the <i>HEAD</i> revision file.</li>
        <li id="li_iqj_dgk_54b" irina="irina">You can use the <uicontrol>Compare view</uicontrol> from the <uicontrol>History
            view</uicontrol> to compare the local file and a selected revision or compare two
          revisions of the same file.</li>
      </ul>The Compare view contains two editors. Edits are allowed only in the left editor and only
      when it contains the working copy file. To learn more about how the view can be used, see
