      <p product="author editor authorEclipse editorEclipse" id="p_epl_bgk_54b">The availability of

          <ph keyref="product"/> includes default <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode views for most
        of the document types it supports. If your company has created its own document types,
          <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode stylesheets may have also been created for that type.
        However, if you create a plain XML file, or one based on a schema that is not included in
        the <ph keyref="product"/> built-in support, you need to edit it in

        clicking the buttons at the bottom left of the editor window. You do not lose any formatting
        when switching from <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode.
          <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> modes are just different

        document as a structured grid of nested tables. This is useful for certain kinds of
        documents, particularly those that are structured like databases. You can also use it when
        you want to display XML content in a table-like manner (for example, if you need to <xref

      <p product="author editor authorEclipse editorEclipse" id="p_hpl_bgk_54b">If you use
          <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, you might find that it is similar to word processors
        that you are used to. Likewise, the <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode is similar to many
        other typical text editors. If you are new to XML, the biggest difference is that XML
        documents have a particular structure that you have to follow. <ph keyref="product"/>
        assists you with a continuous validation of the XML markup.</p>

        edit the document. Some document types give you a lot of choices, while others give you very
        few. In either case, you need to make sure that your document follows the particular

        <li id="li_jpl_bgk_54b" irina="irina">At any given location in the document, there are only certain XML elements allowed. <ph

            press <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol>, <ph keyref="product"/> assumes
            that you want to enter a new element and shows you a list of elements that can be

        <li id="li_kpl_bgk_54b" irina="irina">When you create certain elements, you may find that your text gets a jagged red
          underline and you get a warning that your content is invalid. This is usually because the
          element you have just created requires certain other elements inside of it. Your document
          will be invalid until you create those elements. <ph keyref="product"/> helps you with
          this. If there is only one possible element that can go inside the element you just
          created, <ph keyref="product"/> creates it for you. However, if there is more than one
          possibility, you have to create the appropriate elements yourself. In many cases, <ph
