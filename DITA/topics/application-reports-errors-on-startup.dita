        <title>Cause</title>
        <p id="p_wbk_dgk_54b">This problem may occur if you install the application in a folder where an older version
          of the application was previously installed. Especially on macOS, there is a possibility
          for older resources and libraries from the previous application to remain in the
          installation folder and break the functionality of the newer version of the
          application.</p>

          <p id="p_xbk_dgk_54b">Close the application and completely <xref href="uninstall-application.dita">uninstall
              it</xref>, then install it again. The user-specific settings are saved in a separate
            folder in the user home directory so they will not be lost.<ul id="ul_yf4_rrd_rlb">
              <li id="li_ybk_dgk_54b" irina="irina">On macOS, you can move the entire application installation folder to the

                the extra libraries present in the folder. You can also choose to delete that
