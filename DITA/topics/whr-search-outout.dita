    <p><ph keyref="whr-output"/> output can be configured to work with multiple search engines.</p>
    <p id="p_jtm_1nf_czb">The plugin comes with a <xref keyref="whr-default-search-engine">built-in
        JavaScript-based search engine</xref> configured by default. This search engine runs
      client-side and is recommended for a small or medium-sized documentation, offering a fairly
      good set of features such as sorting results by relevance, 5-star rating mechanism, and custom
      rules for element scoring.</p>
    <p id="p_rfs_1pf_czb">In addition to the built-in search engine, the <ph keyref="whr-output"/>
      output can be easily configured to use the <xref keyref="whr-oxygen-feedback-search-engine"
        >Oxygen Feedback as an external search engine</xref>. This is a more advanced search engine
      that runs server-side, suitable for large documentations, and with a wider range of features
      such as semantic search, faceted search, and labels search.</p>
    <p id="p_spc_qsp_dzb">A general comparison between the <cmdname>built-in search engine</cmdname>
      and the search engine from <ph keyref="product-ofb"/>:</p>
