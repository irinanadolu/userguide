        <li id="li_dbp_dgk_54b" irina="irina">The structural integrity and well-formedness of the document.</li>
        <li id="li_ebp_dgk_54b" irina="irina">A set of best practice rules (such as a maximum number of words in a paragraph).</li>

      <title>Presenting Validation Problems in the Editing Panel</title>
      <p id="p_fbp_dgk_54b">In the editing panel, the validation errors appear underlined in red, while warnings are
        underlined in yellow. On a desktop device, if you hover the mouse over the errors or
        warnings, a tooltip is displayed that provides more information about the problem.</p>

      <title>Validation Side Panel</title>
      <p id="p_gbp_dgk_54b">Details about the validation problems are also presented in the
          <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> side panel. To open the
          <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> side pane, select the <uicontrol><image
            href="../img/WA-Validation22.png"/>Validation</uicontrol> tab in the vertical stripe on
        the right side of the screen. <ph conkeyref="reusables-webapp/side-panel-ph"/></p>
      <p id="p_hbp_dgk_54b">A red marker shows the number of errors found in the document. Each detected problem is
        listed in its own box in this side panel and each box has a colored left border that
        indicates the type of problem.<ul id="ul_ibp_dgk_54b">
          <li id="li_jbp_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Red</b> â€“ Indicates a validation error.</li>
          <li id="li_kbp_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Yellow</b> - Indicates a validation warning.</li>
          <li id="li_lbp_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><b>Blue</b> - Indicates an informational message.</li>
        </ul>If you click (or tap) a validation item in this side panel, that particular problem is
        highlighted in the editor. Similarly, if the cursor is located at a location in the document
        where there is a problem, that particular validation item is highlighted in the
          <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> side panel. The editor and the side panel are
        automatically synced in real time.</p>
