    <p id="p_tnl_dgk_54b">Over the course of time, large projects can accumulate a vast amount of resources from a
      variety of sources. Especially in organizations with a large number of content authors or
      complex project structures, organizing the project resources can become a challenge. Over time
      a variety of actions can cause resources to become orphaned from <xref
        keyref="glossentry_ditamap"><term>DITA maps</term></xref>. To assist you with organizing
      project resources, <ph keyref="product"/> includes the <uicontrol>Find Unreferenced
        Resources</uicontrol> action, that searches for such resources.</p>
    <p id="p_unl_dgk_54b">To perform this search, open the <term>DITA map</term> in the <xref
        href="dita-maps-manager.dita#dita-maps-manager"><uicontrol>DITA Maps
        Manager</uicontrol></xref>, invoke the contextual menu on the <term>map</term>, and select
      the <uicontrol>Find Unreferenced Resources</uicontrol> action. <ph product="author editor">It
        can also be selected from the <uicontrol>DITA Maps</uicontrol> menu. </ph>This action opens
      the <uicontrol>Find Unreferenced Resources</uicontrol> dialog box, shown below.</p>

    <p id="p_xnl_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Find Unreferenced Resources</uicontrol> dialog box includes the following
      options:</p>
    <p id="p_ynl_dgk_54b">
      <ul id="ul_bt1_wtv_5q">
        <li id="li_znl_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>DITA Maps</uicontrol> - Provides a list of <term>DITA maps</term> to be
          included in the search and allows you to <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> maps to the list or
            <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol> them.</li>
        <li id="li_a4l_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Folders</uicontrol> - Provides a list of folders to be included in the search
          and allows you to <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol> specific
          folders. All files from this list of folders that are not referenced from the maps
          specified in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps</uicontrol> list will be reported.</li>
        <li id="li_b4l_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Filters</uicontrol> - Provides three combo boxes that allow you to filter the
          search to include or exclude certain files or folders:<ul id="ul_gqh_rwv_5q">

                filters by separating them with a comma and you can use the <i>?</i> and <i>*</i>
                wildcards. Use the drop-down arrow to select a previously used filter

    <p id="p_g4l_dgk_54b">When you click the <uicontrol>Find</uicontrol> button, if the search operation finds
      unreferenced resources, they are displayed in the <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel at the
      bottom of the editor. If you want to delete an unreferenced resource, you can right-click its
      result and select <uicontrol>Remove from Disk</uicontrol>. If you want to see the resource
      before deciding what to do with it, you can right-click its result and select <uicontrol>Show
        in Explorer</uicontrol>.</p>
