    <p id="p_hpj_dgk_54b">Sometimes you need to know not only what was changed in a file, but also who made those
      changes. The <uicontrol>Annotations</uicontrol> view displays the revision and the author that
      changed every line in a file. The annotations of a file are computed and this view is opened
      with the <uicontrol><image href="../img/SVNAnnotationsView16.gif"/>Show Annotation</uicontrol>
      action, which is available in the <uicontrol>History</uicontrol> menu, and from the contextual
      menu of the following views: <xref href="repository-view.dita"
          ><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view</xref>, <xref
        href="working-copy-view.dita#working-copy-view"><uicontrol>Working copy</uicontrol>
        view</xref>, <xref href="history-view.dita"><uicontrol>History</uicontrol> view</xref>, and
        <xref href="svn-dir-change-set-view.dita#svn-dir-change-set-view"><uicontrol>Directory
          Change Set</uicontrol> view</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p_ipj_dgk_54b">This action opens a dialog box that allows you to configure some options for showing the
      annotations.</p>

          placement="inline"/>
      </fig>
    </p>
    <p id="p_kpj_dgk_54b">Once you have configured the options and click <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>, the
        <uicontrol>Annotations</uicontrol> view is displayed (by default, on the right side of the
      application). You can click a line in the editor panel where the file is opened to see the
      revision where the line was last modified. The same revision is highlighted in the
        <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> and you can also see all the lines that were changed in
      the same revision highlighted in the editor panel. Also, the entries of the
        <uicontrol>Annotations view</uicontrol> corresponding to that revision are highlighted.
      Therefore, the <uicontrol>Annotations view</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol>,
      and annotations editor panel are all synchronized. Clicking a line in one of them highlights
      the corresponding lines in the other two.</p>

          <dd>Select the encoding to be used when the annotation is computed. For each line of text,
            the SVN Client looks through the history of the file to be annotated see when it was
            last modified, and by whom. It is required that it is in the form of a text file.
            Therefore, encoding is needed to properly decode and read the file content. By default,
            the encoding of the operating system is used.</dd>

        <dlentry id="dlentry_rpj_dgk_54b">
          <dt><uicontrol>Ignore MIME type</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>If selected, the file is treated as a text file and ignores what the SVN system infers
            from the <codeph>svn:mime-type</codeph> property.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry id="dlentry_spj_dgk_54b">

          <dt><uicontrol>Ignore whitespaces</uicontrol></dt>
          <dd>If selected, it allows you to specify how the whitespace changes should be handled.
            When selected, you can then choose between two options:<ul id="ul_pch_xmr_4r">
              <li id="li_upj_dgk_54b" irina="irina"><uicontrol>Ignore whitespace changes</uicontrol> - Ignores changes in the amount
                of whitespaces or to their type (for example, when changing the indentation or
                changing tabs to spaces).<note id="note_vpj_dgk_54b">Whitespaces that were added where there were none
                  before, or that were removed, are still considered to be changes.</note></li>

      </dl><note type="tip" id="note_xpj_dgk_54b">Selecting any of these <i>ignore</i> options can help you better
        determine the last time a meaningful change was made to a given line of text.</note></p>
    <p id="p_ypj_dgk_54b">After you configure the options and click <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>, the annotations will be
      computed and the <uicontrol>Annotations</uicontrol> view is displayed, where all the users
      that modified the selected resource will be presented, along with the specific lines and
      revision numbers modified by each user.<note type="note" id="note_zpj_dgk_54b">If the file has a very long history,
        the computation of the annotation data can take a long time to process.</note>
